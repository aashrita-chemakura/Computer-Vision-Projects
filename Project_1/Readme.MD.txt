Problem 1)
	Pre-requisites:
	importing required libraries-  OpenCV
				       Numpy
				       Matplotlib.pyplot
	Steps:
	1) Run the code.
	2) The video of the trajectory of the ball will be displayed. Wait until the trajectory is displayed completely.
	3) Press 'q' incase the plot doesn't show up automatically.
	4) The result will display the plots of original trajectory of the ball, the x-coordinate of the landing spot of the ball and plot of the equation of parabolic curve.

Problem 2.1)
	Pre-requisites:
	importing required libraries- Numpy
	 
	Make sure that the data files are present in the folder.
	
	Steps:
	1) Run the code. 
	2) The result will display the covariance matrix, the direction and magnitude of the surface normal.

Problem 2.2)
