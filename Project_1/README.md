# Project 1

## Problem 1: Trajectory of a Ball

### Pre-requisites:
- Import the required libraries:
  - OpenCV
  - Numpy
  - Matplotlib.pyplot

### Steps:
1. Run the code.
2. A video showing the trajectory of the ball will be displayed. Wait until the trajectory is fully displayed.
3. If the plot does not show up automatically, press 'q'.
4. The result will display:
   - The original trajectory of the ball.
   - The x-coordinate of the landing spot of the ball.
   - The plot of the equation of the parabolic curve.

## Problem 2.1: Covariance Matrix and Surface Normal

### Pre-requisites:
- Import the required libraries:
  - Numpy

- Ensure that the data files are present in the folder.

### Steps:
1. Run the code.
2. The result will display:
   - The covariance matrix.
   - The direction and magnitude of the surface normal.

## Problem 2.2: 3D Plots of Best Fit Planes

### Pre-requisites:
- Import the required libraries:
  - Numpy
  - Matplotlib

### Steps:
1. Run the code.
2. The result will display:
   - 3D plots of the equations of the best fit planes using least squares, total least squares, and RANSAC.
   - The solution of the equation.
